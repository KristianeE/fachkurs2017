# Introduction to Python

Python (as in Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus) is fun! 
Apart from that it is:
- highly readable. 
- based on multiple programming paradigms. You can use it to program object-oriented, imperative and functional. 
- an interpreted language - Python code can be executed at the moment it is written. 


This tutorial will explain Python mainly by example. It is build upon the official Python tutorial (http://docs.python.org/tutorial/) and can be considered a customized summary of this tutorial.


You will learn about:
- the Python interpreter
- the Python interactive shell
- basic data types
- casting
- if statements
- for and while loops
- list comprehensions
- break and continue statements
- functions, default values, and keyword arguments
- comments and documentation
- a bit of coding style

## Exercises

Now you have enough time to try what you learned in the introduction! Please do [these excercises](https://github.com/fugufisch/hu_bp_python_course/blob/master/02_introduction/exercise.md).


## For further reading and exercises, try:

- Code Academy course - good basic start http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python
- Python the Hard Way - excellent book and workshop http://learnpythonthehardway.org/
- Open Tech School course http://python.opentechschool.org/#python-beginners

In Berlin, you can also go to meetups to learn Python (and lots of other stuff). One good group to do so would be the [Open Tech School](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/).
