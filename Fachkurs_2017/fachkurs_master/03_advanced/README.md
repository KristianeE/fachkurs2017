After you learned the basic principles of python programming yesterday, we will now try to tell you more about the background and concepts of the language. This will encorporate the following main topics:

- Python's really simple **package** system
- Object Orientation
- Common Pitfalls

In the excercise you will implement a small module that uses the above concepts to model protein translation.
